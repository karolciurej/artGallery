Problems:
-Learning to use TypeScript, mostly typing by force with interfaces; unsure if this is the right approach.
-Implementing fetch to an API.
-Using Expo Router.
-I'm using both expo/routing and react-navigation, and struggled with passing a variable to a dynamic route using expo routing.
-Naming conventions and file structure; I'm somewhat lost on how to organize files. Random errors related to them prompted me not to modify them as long as they work.
-Not every element has latitude and I made aspect ratio in other way
-Lots of nulls in the API; often, the things I want to use in the app are mostly empty and I don't use them
